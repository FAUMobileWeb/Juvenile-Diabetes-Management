#Homework 1
Due 9/21/16 Midnight

Ideally, I would like all the quizzes, homeworks and  project assignments to work towards your App. So, this HW 1 could be based on what you wish to do for your App Or you could choose one of the topics given on page 40 of the text book under the heading of "Programming Projects." If you were to work on your app for this assignment, this assignment would become the information page: the general theory/knowledge/explanation/references/links page that  provides additional information for the user, but does not clutter the user accessed pages with too much information. Look at the programming projects on page 40 to get a general idea on what kind of information you might wish to include there.

Make the document pleasing, concise, and useful. Use HTML and CSS. Upload to the lamp server. Save a copy of the project folder at Github, in a folder entitled "Information Page." What to provide at BB: A link to the appropriate Github folder and Lamp URL to the page. In the long term, all Github folders need to be arranged well for others to access and use. The main purpose of Github is to support you with versioning control. I will explain in the class. We are also using it in this course as a place for full documentation of your App. It is an open source site. I hope others will benefit from your work, as we are benefiting from others. 

Thanks

Dr. Shankar
