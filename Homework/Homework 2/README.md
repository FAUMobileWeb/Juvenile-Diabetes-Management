#Homework 2
Due 10/28/16 Before Class

This is a group project. If you work on your group project for this homework, you will be achieving two things at the same time, viz.,  make progress on the project and also complete an assignment for class purposes. If you wish to continue with the individual homework 1 assignment for this also, that is OK with me - just note you still have to do similar work for your group project. Either way, submit under your name. BB will recognize which group you are in and the grade will be good for your partner too (unless he/she submits a separate one). This refers to building mobile friendly and responsive app screens as covered in Chapter 3.

If individual: Continue with the Programming projects. Do the corresponding problem at the end of Chapter 3/ page 62-63. It should be mobile friendly and responsive.

If Group: Pick one or more of your Balsamiq mockup screens and build the corresponding mobile web friendly and responsive screen.

What to submit: Submit the whole project folder at Github and give me the link at BB. If it is your project, you can start populating your lamp.cse.fau.edu server instance with the partial app and give me that link too at BB.

No need to give me a zip folder at Github. However, if you do give me the same, I would appreciate it!

Thanks.
